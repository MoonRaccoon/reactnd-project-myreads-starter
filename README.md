This is my submission for the final assessment project for Udacity's
React Fundamentals course. To get this project installed and running
on your machine:

* Clone or Download the project to your machine
* Using the terminal, navigate to inside the project folder
* Run the following commands, in order:
```
npm install
npm start
```

The project should then open in your browser. If it doesn't for any reason,
open your browser and manually navigate to localhost:3000.
